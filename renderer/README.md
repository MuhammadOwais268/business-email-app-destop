This renderer is a minimal React + Vite app for the Electron PoC.

Dev steps:

1. Install dependencies in the root of the project (see top-level README).
2. Run the renderer dev server:

```bash
npm run dev:renderer
```

It serves the renderer on http://localhost:5173 by default. The Electron main process will load that URL in development mode.
